Version 0.0.0.3
===============

The examples - apart from `hmcpi` - now accept the `--debug` command-line
option which causes the messages sent to, and received from, MineCraft
to be printed to the standard-error channel. The format of these 
messages has been changed slightly.

Version 0.0.0.2
===============

Minor document improvements. Added examples/XJump.hs, which is the
example used in the documentation for Network.MineCraft.Pi.Client.

Version 0.0.0.1
===============

Initial version.
